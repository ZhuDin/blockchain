Converting integers to and from host to network byte order

If you ever need to write a low-level network application, it
may be necessary to handle the low-level data transmission
over the wire between two machines. This operation
requires some sort of conversion of data from the native
host operating system to the network format and vice
versa. This is because each one has its own specific
representation of data.


How to do it...

Python's socket library has utilities for converting from a 
network byte order to host order and vice versa. You may
want to become familiar with them, for example,
ntohl()/htonl().
