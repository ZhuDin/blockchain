Introduction

This chapter focuses on improving the socket server
performance using a few useful techniques. Unlike the
previous chapter, here we consider multiple clients that 
will be connected to the server and the communication can
be asynchronous. Ther server does not need to process the 
request from clients in a blocking manner; this can be done
independently of each other. If one client takes more time
to receive or process data, the server does not need to wait
for that. It can talk to other clients using separate threads or
processes.
