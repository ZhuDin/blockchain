Using ThreadingMixIn in your socket server applications

Perhaps you prefer writing a multi-thread application over a process-based one due to any 
particular reason, for example, sharing the states of that application across threads, 
avoiding the complexity of inter-process communication, or something else, In such a situation, 
if you want to write an asynchronous network server using SocketServer library, you will
need ThreadMixIn.


Getting ready

By making a few minor changes to our previous recipe, you can get a working version of 
socket server using ThreadMixIn.


How to do it...

As seen in the previous socket server based on ForkingMixIn, ThreadingMixIn socket server 
will follow the same coding pattern of an echo server except for a few things. First, our
ThreadTCPServer will inherit from TCPServer and ThreadingMixIn. This multi-threaded version
will launch a new thread when a client connects to it. Some more details can be found at
http://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html.
