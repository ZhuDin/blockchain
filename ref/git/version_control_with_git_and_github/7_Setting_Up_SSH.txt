SSH Configuration

To interact with a repository and/or conduct tasks on GitHub from
your local environment, you need to assert you are who you say you are.
Git supports this by using a combination of a username and password,
or using a SSH key to authenticate a connection or requests made on 
GitHub from your local environment.

The use of SSH keys ensures enhanced security and averts the need to
provide a username and password for each request.


Exercise 7: Setting Up SSH

To set up the SSH key for the account, follow these steps:

1. Launch the Terminal or command prompt.

2. Generate a SSH key using the following command:
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "[email_address]"
   Example: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "kifeh@poly-swarm.com"

3. Specify the location where the generated key is to be stored. You may
   press Enter to instruct the key generator to use the default location.

4. Type a passphrase to secure the generated key.

The key is sotred in the specified location.

1. Start the SSH agent using the following command 
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)".

2. On macOS, edit ~/.ssh/config to enable the ssh-agent to automatically
   load keys and store passphrases in the keychain:
    Host *
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile [location_of_the_generated_private_key]

   Example: Host *:
    AddKeysToAgent yes
    UseKeychain yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/version_control_git/id_rsa

3. Add the SSH private key to the ssh-agent.

   Note
   -k adds the passphrase to the keychain when a private key is added
   to the ssh-agent.

    ssh-add -K [location_of_the_generated_private_key]

   Example: ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/version_control_git/id_rsa

4. Add the public SSH key to your GitHub account. Go to 
   https://github.com/, and then go to Setting.

5. Click SSH and GPG keys as shown in the following screenshot.

6. Click New SSH key and set a title for your public SSH key.

7. Launch the Terminal and copy the contents of the public SSH key 
   to the clipboard using the following command:
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/version_control_git/id_rsa.pub.

8. Paste the contents of the public key into the field under the 
   label Key.

9. Click Add SSH key to add the public key to your GitHub account.

10.Test that the SSH key has been set up properly by making a request
   to GitHub using the following command:
    ssh -T git@github.com

You have successfully set up the SSH key for the account.
