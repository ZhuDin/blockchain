git rm

The git rm command performs two roles. These roles are 
used to remove files from the working directory and the index.


Removing Files From the Index

What doesn't git rm do?

git rm cannot remove a file from the working tree and 
ratain the same file in the index.

git rm follows the following syntax:

git rm [options] [path_file_or_directory]

The options avaiable for the git rm command are -n or --dry-run.

This option simulates the behavior of git rm for the
specified files. -n and --dry-run do not do the actual 
removal.

-r

This option is applicable when using the git rm command
in a directory. It removes the directory's contents
recursively. This means that the directory and its contents
are removed.

--cached

This option remove the specified files from the index only.

-f or --force

git rm checks the files marked for removal for matches, 
with the files in HEAD, at the tip of the current branch.
This check is conducted before the file(s) are removed. The 
-f option overrides this check.


Exercise 15: Removing Files from the Working Tree and the Index

To remove files from the index or the working tree.

1. Lanuch the Terminal and navigate to the location of the 
   abacus repository.

2. Create the scientific.py file in src/lib by using 
   the following command:
    echo '$ Scientific arithmetic module' > src/lib/scientific.py

3. Track the added file by using the git add src/lib/scientific.py command

4. Remove the file from the index by using the git rm -- cached src/lib/scientific.py command

5. Remove the file from the index and the working tree by
   using the following code:
    git add src/lib/scientific.py
    git commit -m "Add scientific module"
    git rm src/lib/scientific.py
    git status
    git commit =m "Remove scientific module"
    ls src/lib


Outcome

By completing this excise, you should be able to remove
an undesired file from the index and the working tree.


Note

The rm command removes the specified file from the working
tree only. The git rm command, on the other hand, removes
the file from the index and the working tree. This provides a
shorter process for deleting files, since with rm, you need to run
git add to impact the deletion process in the index.
