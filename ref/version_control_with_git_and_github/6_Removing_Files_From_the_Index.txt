git rm

The git rm command performs two roles. These roles are 
used to remove files from the working directory and the index.


Removing Files From the Index

What doesn't git rm do?

git rm cannot remove a file from the working tree and 
ratain the same file in the index.

git rm follows the following syntax:

git rm [options] [path_file_or_directory]

The options avaiable for the git rm command are -n or --dry-run.

This option simulates the behavior of git rm for the
specified files. -n and --dry-run do not do the actual 
removal.

-r

This option is applicable when using the git rm command
in a directory. It removes the directory's contents
recursively. This means that the directory and its contents
are removed.

--cached

This option remove the specified files from the index only.

-f or --force

git rm checks the files marked for removal for matches, 
with the files in HEAD, at the tip of the current branch.
This check is conducted before the file(s) are removed. The 
-f option overrides this check.
