LICENSE

A license governs the utilization of an application by its
users by dictating the obligations and responsibilities of
the creator and user of a software application.

Licenses are applicable, for example, in averting a creator
from indemnifying a user when an application is used contrary
to its terms of use.


Exercise 11: Adding Licenses

To add the appropriate license to the document, follow
these steps:

0. Open your repository, choose Insights table.

1. Click the Add button to the right of License on the
   Community profile.

2. Choose a preferred license. In this case, we shall choose
   the MIT License.

3. Click Review and submit once you have finished reviewing
   the document.

4. Commit the document. You can alter this document to
   fit your project.


Outcome

You have successfully added the MIT license to a given
repository.


Wikis and Issues

Take a look at the following definitions:


Wiki

Wikis provide an avenue for documenting processes and
guides for the usage of a certain piece of software.

You can use wikis to document conventions that should be
applied in creating branches, reporting issues, and making
feature requests.

To access and/or create wikis, use the Wiki button on the
top navigation bar.

We shall use wikis to document best practices and conventions
for the application we will be building in this book.


Issues

GitHub issues are suitable in reporting challenges or bugs
that are encountered when using an application, as well
as in making feature requests. Issues aid in tracking tasks
that:

 * Need to be undertaken as part of a products roadmap
 * Respond to user requests and challenges reported

To facilitate the filing of issues, we need to create templates
that serves to ease the reporting process. You will
need to click the Add button to the right of Issues template
on the Community profile. Then, select the Bug report and
Feature request templates.

By clicking the Propose changes button and Commit
changes thereafter to add the template to your repository,
you will be able to file the issue request.


Raising an Issue

This is easily achieved by selecting the Issue tab on the
top repository navigation bar.

Then, click New issue to file an issue. On the next prompt,
select the appropriate issue type, for example, Bug report.
Lastly, you can provide details of your issue and click
submit new issue to complete the process.


Activity 1: Creating a Repository

You have been instructed to build an application that
enables its user to order food from a restaurant and have it
delivered. To commence this piece of work, you need to
build the application while leveraging version control. You
need to create a repository that will host the application.
This repository will be used to track task completion and
the deployment of the application.

To get started, you need to have the Git command-line tool
installed on your computer. Additionally you need to have
an account on https://github.com/ and be logged into your
account on Github:

1. Launch the Terminal.

2. Create a directory named [dine-in] for the application
   and navigate to the dine-in directory.

3. Initialize the repository.

4. Go to https://github.com/ to create a new repository
   with the name dine-in.

5. Obtain the HTTPS or SSH URL of the repository from
   GitHub.

6. Set the remote URL on the local repository:

   git remote add origin [URL]

7. Create a README file and a .gitignore file, both of
   which are going to be added to the index.

8. Commit the files and then push them to the remote
   repository:

   git push -u origin master


Outcome

You have successfully created a repository on your GitHub
account with README.md and .gitignore files


Note

For detailed of this activity, refer to the Appendix section.


Logistics

Conduct a recap of the concepts that have been covered in
this topic.


Summary

In this chapter, we defined version control and the various
types of workflows that are used. Then, we looked at what
Git and GitHub are, and how they relate to each other. Last,
but not least, we reated a repository on GitHub, cloned it,
and initialized a repository on a local environment before
uploading (pushing) it to GitHub. Basic building blocks
of version control and the application context were also
introduced.

In the next chapter, you will finally see how to version
commits and file stages to track file increments. You will
also raise a pull request and merge it to the primary branch
of a repository.
