Organizations

GitHub offers the ability to manage multiple projects and, be extension,
repositories using a shared account that's referred to as an organization.
Using an organization, you can arrange contributors in a project to reflect
your organization's structure. This structure corresponds to the teams that
work on the respective projects as well as the access rights assigned to the
individual contributors on each team.

Organizations spur seamless coordination of work through the following features
availed by GitHub:

1. Role-based membership. Three roles exist in role-based membership, that is,
   owner, billing manager, and member. Each personal account that is added to
   an organization can belong to one of teh aforementioned roles. The owner role
   is the most superior and is used to conduct administrative procedures.

2. Repository level permissions. Teams or their respective members can be assigned
   read, write, or admin-level permissions to a repository. Each level dictates 
   activities that the assigned members undertake, with a varying degree of limitations.
   The following diagram shows the three levels of permission, in order of increasing
   capabilities, that ar availabel in the respective levels:

		Admin 	>	Write		>	Read

3. Teams: These are members of an organization that can be grouped into teams, with 
   option of nesting the teams to match an organization's structure.

4. Multi-factor authentication: Organizations support the enforcement of two-factor
   as well as business-specific single sign-on approaches such as Security Assertion
   Markup language (SAML) and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM).
