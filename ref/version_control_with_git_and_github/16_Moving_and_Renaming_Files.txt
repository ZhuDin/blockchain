git mv

In the event that you need to update the index for both,
old and new paths automatically, the git mv command
serves that purpose.

This command has two forms of implementation:

1. git mv [options] [source] [destination]
2. git mv [options] [source] ... [destination]

  (1) is used to rename a file.
  (2) is used to move a file.


Exercise 16: Moving and Renaming Files

To learn how to handle files and directories using Git, follow
these steps:

1. Launch the Terminal and navigate to the location of the
   abacus repository.

2. Create the scientific.py file in src/lib by using
   the following command:
    echo '# Scientific arithmetic module' > src/lib/scientific.py

3. Add the file to the index and commit it by using the following
   command:
    git add src/lib/scientific.py && git commit -C [commit_hash] --no-edit

4. Rename the file by using the git mv src/lib/scientific.py   src/lib/advance_compute.py command

5. Commit the file by using the git commit -m "Rename scientific module" command

6. Move the file by using the following commands:
    mkdir -p src/lib/advanced/
    git mv src/lib/advanced_compute.py   src/lib/advanced/


Outcome

By completing exercise, you should be able to rename
and move files and directories using git mv.
