Printing the current time from the internet time server

Many programs rely on the accurate machine time, such as
the make command in UNIX. Your machine time may be
different and need synchronizing with another time server
in your network.


Getting ready

In order to synchronize your machine time with one of the
internet time servers, you can write a Python client for that.
For this, ntplib will be used. Here, the client/server
conversation will be done using Network Time Protocol
(NTP). If ntplib is not installed on your machine, you can get
it from PyPI with the following command using pip or easy_install:

$ pip install ntplib


How to do it...

We create an instance of NTPClient and then we call the 
request() method on it by passing the NTP server address.

Listing 1-11 shows how to print the current time from the 
internet time server as follows:
import ntplib
from time import ctime

def print_time():
    ntp_client = ntplib.NTPClient()
    response = ntp_client.request('pool.ntp.org')
    print(ctime(response.tx_time))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print_time()

In my machine, this recipe shows the following output:

  Mon Sep  2 15:42:46 2019


How it works...

Here, an NTP client has been created and an NTP request
has been sent to one of the internet NTP servers,
pool.ntp.org. The ctime() function is used for printing the 
response.
