Abstract

This monograph aims at providing an introduction to key
concepts, algorithms, and theoretical results in machine learning.
The treatment concentrates on probabilistic models
for supevised and unsupervised learning problems. It 
introduceds fundamental concepts and algorithms by building
on first priciples, while also exposing the reader to more
advanced topics with extensive pointers to the literature,
within a unified notation and mathematical framework. The 
material is organized according to clearly defined categories,
such as discriminative and generative models, frequentist
and Bayesian approaches, exact and approximate inference,
as well as directed and undirected models. This monograph
is meant as an entry point for researchers with an engineering
background in probability and linear algebra.
