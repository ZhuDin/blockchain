11 - The Environment

As we discussed earlier, the shell maintains a body of information during our shell session
called the environment. Programs use data stored in the environment to determine
facts about the system's configuration. While most programs use configuration files to
store program setting, some programs also look for values stored in the environment to
adjust their behavior. Knowing this, we can use the environment to customize our shell
experience.

In this chapter, we will work with the following commands:

  * printenv - Print part of all of the environment
  * set - Set shell options
  * export - Export environment to subsequently executed programs
  * alias - Create an alias for a command


What is Stored in the Environment?

The shell stores two basic types of data in the envinroment; though, with bash, teh
types are largely indistinguishable. They are environment variables and shell variables.
Shell variables are bits of data placed there by bash, and environment variables are 
everything else. In addition to variables, the shell stores some programmatic data, namely
aliases and shell functions. We covered aliases in Chapter 5, "Working with Commands."
and we will cover shell functions (which are related to shell scripting) in Part 4.
