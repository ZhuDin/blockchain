12 - A Gentle Introduction to vi

There is an old joke about a visitor to New York City asking a passerby for directions to
the city's famous classical music venue:

Visitor: Excuse me, how do I get to Carnegie Hall?

Passerby: Practice, practice, practice!

Leaning the Linux command line, like becoming an accomplished pianist, is not something 
that we pick up in an afternoon. It takes years of practice. In this chapter, we will
introduce the vi (pronounced "vee eye") text editor, one of the core programs in the
Unix tradition. vi is somewhat notorious for its difficult user interface, but when we see
a master sit down at the keyboard and being to "play", we will indeed be witness to some
great art. We won't become masters in the chapter, but when we are done, we will know
how to play "chopsticks" in vi.
