10 - Processes

Modern operating systems are usually multitasking, meaning they create the illusion of
doing more than one thing at once by rapidly switching from one executing program to
another. The Linux kernel manages this through the use of processes. Processes are how
Linux organizes the different programs waiting for their turn at the CPU.

Sometimes a computer will become sluggish or an application will stop responding. In
this chapter, we will look at some of the tools available at the command line that let us
examine what programs are doing and how to terminate processes that are misbehaving.

This chapter will introduce the following commands:
 
  * ps - Report a snapshot of current processes
  * top - Display tasks
  * jobs - List active jobs
  * bg - Place a job in the background
  * fg - Place a job in the foreground
  * kill - Send a signal to a process
  * killall - Kill processes by name
  * shutdown - Shutdown or reboot the system


How a Process Works

When a system starts up, the kernel initiates a few of its own activities as processes and
launches a program called init.init, in turn, runs a series of shell scripts (located in
/etc) called init scripts, which start all the system services.
