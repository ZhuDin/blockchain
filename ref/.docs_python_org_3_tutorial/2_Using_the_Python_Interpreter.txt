2.2.1. Source Code Encoding

By  default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages
in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments -- although the standard
library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all
these characters properly, your editor must recongnize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports
all the characters in the file.
