1.4 Analysis of Algorithms

As People Gain Experience Using Computers, they use them to solve difficult problems
or process large amounts of data and are invariably led to questions like these:

	How long will my program take?
	Why does my program run out of memory?

You certainly have asked yourself these question, perhaps when rebuilding music or
photo library, installing a new application, working with a large document, or working
with a large amount of experimental data. The questions are much too vague to
be answered precisely--the answers depend on many factors such as properties of the
particular computer being used, the particular data being processed, and the particular 
program that is doing the job (which implements some algorithm). All of these factors
leave us with a daunting amount of information to analyze.
