1. Getting Started

Let's start your Rust journey! There's a lot to learn, but evey journey starts somewhere. In this
chapter, we'll discuss:

  * Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  * Writing a program that prints Hello, world!
  * Using cargo, Rust's package manager and build system


Summary

You're already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, you've learned how to:
  
  * Install the latest stable version of Rust using rustup
  * Update to a newer Rust version
  * Open locally installed documentation
  * Write and run a Hello, world! program using rustc directly
  * Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo

This is great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading and writing Rust
code. So, in Chapter 2, we'll build a guessing game program. If you would rather start by learning
how common programming concepts work in Rust, see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.
