Controlling How Tests Are Run

Just as cargo run compiles your code and then runs the resulting binary, cargo test compilers 
your code in test mode and runs the resulting test binary. You can specify command line options to 
change the default behavior of cargo test. For example, the default behavior of the binary 
produced by cargo test is to run all the tests in parallel and capture output generated during test
runs, preventing the output from being displayed and making it easier to read the output related to
the test results.

Some command line options go to cargo test, and some go to the resulting test binary. To 
separate these two types of arguments, you list the arguments that go to cargo test followed by
the separator -- and then the ones that go to the test binary. Running cargo test --help displays 
the options you can use with cargo test, and running cargo test -- --help displays the options 
you can use after the separator --.
