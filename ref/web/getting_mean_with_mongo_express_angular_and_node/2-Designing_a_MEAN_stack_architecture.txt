2-Designing a MEAN stack architecture

This chapter covers
■ Introducing a common MEAN stack architecture
■ Considerations for single-page applications
■ Discovering alternative MEAN stack architectures
■ Designing an architecture for a real application
■ Planning a build based on the architecture design

In chapter 1 we took a look at the component parts of the MEAN stack and how
they fit together. In this chapter we’re going to look at how they fit together in
more detail.

We’ll start off by looking at what some people think of as the MEAN stack architecture, 
especially when they first encounter the stack. Using some examples we’ll
explore why you might use a different architecture, and switch things up a bit and
move things around. MEAN is a very powerful stack and can be used to solve a
diverse range of problems … if you get creative with how you design your solutions.
