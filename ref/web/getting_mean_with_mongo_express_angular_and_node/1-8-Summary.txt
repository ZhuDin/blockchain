In this chapter we’ve covered
■ The different technologies making up the MEAN stack
■ MongoDB as the database layer
■ Node.js and Express working together to provide an application server layer
■ AngularJS providing an amazing front-end, data-binding layer
■ How the MEAN components work together

As JavaScript plays such a pivotal role in the stack, please take a look at appendix D
(available online), which has a refresher on JavaScript pitfalls and best practices.

Coming up next in chapter 2 we’re going to discuss how flexible the MEAN stack is,
and how you can architect it differently for different scenarios.
